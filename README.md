# sorting-visualizer
## About the Project
This is a website that visualizes different sorting methods. It allows the user to choose between generating a new array, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Bubble Sort. I built this project because I had seen sorting visualizers on social media and was curious if I could implement the code for one. By completing this project I learned more about javascript such as async functions, sound, and creating animation.
